# Federated Documentation #

Doclava supports federated documentation. If your project depends on another project that was generated by Doclava or has publicly available source code, Doclava can automatically create links to classes and methods in the remote site for that other project.

Federation requires two things of the other project: an available documentation site, and a machine-readable description of the site's contents. Doclava uses an .xml file for this description.

For documentation sites built with Doclava, this file is automatically placed in the generated documentation, and so you can configure federation with the arguments:

```
  -federate Project http://project.com/reference
```

For projects with documentation you want to link to that have no .xml file, you can generate an xml file for that codebase by running Doclava on its source code with arguments:

```
  -nodocs -apixml path/to/api.xml
```

and then federate against that project's existing documentation with:

```
  -federate Project http://project.com/reference
  -federationxml Project path/to/api.xml
```

The federation xml file may be a local file or an http link. We have several [Android and Open JDK sample api.xml](http://doclava.googlecode.com/svn/static/api/) files available for use.
